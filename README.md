# ProblemAtlas

> **Startup opportunity discovery, on autopilot.**
> Scrapes Reddit & Hacker News for real user pain points, scores them with Gemini AI, and surfaces the ones worth building on.

🔗 **Live:** https://problem-atlas--animeforever69o.replit.app/

## What it does

Founders and indie hackers spend hours manually scrolling forums hunting for problems worth solving. ProblemAtlas automates that entire pipeline:

1. **Auto-scrapes** Reddit (`r/Entrepreneur`, `r/startups`, `r/SaaS`, `r/webdev`, `r/devops`, `r/productivity`) and Hacker News every 6 hours, filtering posts with keywords like "frustrated with", "wish there was", "no good tool for"
2. **AI-scores** each post using **Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite** across 6 dimensions — frequency, severity, market size, trend direction, competition level, and build feasibility
3. **Filters ruthlessly** — only opportunities with a composite score ≥ 6.0 / 10 are stored
4. **Presents a ranked feed** of vetted opportunities with full breakdowns: pain points, TAM estimates, competitor weaknesses, MVP spec, and risk analysis
5. **Accepts community submissions** — anyone can submit a problem manually for review

## AI Scoring Model

Each post is evaluated by Gemini across 6 dimensions (0–10):

| Dimension | What it measures |
|---|---|
| **Frequency** | How often people face this problem |
| **Severity** | How painful the problem is |
| **Market** | Total addressable market potential |
| **Trend** | Whether the problem space is growing |
| **Competition** | How uncrowded the solution space is (10 = no competition) |
| **Feasibility** | How buildable a solution is |

The **composite score** is the unweighted mean of the six. Posts scoring below 6.0 are discarded. Approved entries include a full MVP spec, TAM/WTP estimate, named competitors and their weaknesses, and a bear-case risk analysis.

## API Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/opportunities` | List opportunities (filter by category, search, minScore, sortBy) |
| `GET` | `/api/opportunities/top` | Top N opportunities by score |
| `GET` | `/api/opportunities/:id` | Single opportunity detail |
| `POST` | `/api/opportunities/submit` | Submit a problem manually |
| `POST` | `/api/admin/scrape` | Trigger scraper manually |
| `GET` | `/api/stats` | Aggregate stats (total, avg score, top category) |
| `GET` | `/api/categories` | Category breakdown with counts and avg scores |
| `GET` | `/api/health` | Health check |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 24+
- pnpm 9+
- PostgreSQL database
- Gemini API key ([get one free](https://aistudio.google.com/))

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Noorislam-XD/ProblemAtlas-app.git
cd ProblemAtlas-app

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Set environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in DATABASE_URL and GEMINI_API_KEY

# Push DB schema
pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push

# Start the API server (port 5000)
pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run dev

# In a second terminal — start the frontend (port 5173)
pnpm --filter @workspace/problem-atlas run dev
```

### Build for production

```bash
pnpm run build
# Output: artifacts/api-server/dist/ + artifacts/problem-atlas/dist/
```

### Deploy to Railway

The repo includes `railway.json`. Connect the repo to a Railway project, add `DATABASE_URL` and `GEMINI_API_KEY` as environment variables, and Railway will handle the rest. The API server serves the compiled frontend as static files in production.


## Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run dev` | Run API server in dev mode |
| `pnpm --filter @workspace/problem-atlas run dev` | Run frontend dev server |
| `pnpm run typecheck` | Full typecheck across all packages |
| `pnpm run build` | Typecheck + build all packages |
| `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen` | Regenerate API hooks and Zod schemas from OpenAPI spec |
| `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push` | Push DB schema changes (dev only) |
